# Senior Research Project: Web Accessibility Tool Comparison

## Objective
The goal of this project is to compare two web accessibility testing tools — **WAVE** and **AXE DevTools** — to determine which one provides more accurate and user-friendly accessibility assessments.  

## Background
Ensuring that websites meet accessibility standards is a key step toward digital inclusivity. Tools like WAVE and AXE DevTools automate this process, but their accuracy and usability can vary. This study focuses on evaluating both tools using a standardized set of government (.gov) websites to ensure consistency and reliability in testing.

## Methodology
- **Tools Tested:** WAVE and AXE DevTools  
- **Sample:** 10 randomly selected `.gov` websites  
- **Evaluation Criteria:**  
  - Accuracy of accessibility issue detection  
  - User interface and ease of use  
  - Consistency of results across pages  

## Expected Outcome
This project aims to determine which tool offers better usability for accessibility professionals and developers, and to provide recommendations for improving automated accessibility evaluations.
